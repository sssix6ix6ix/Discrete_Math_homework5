Here is a software solution for some problems from Homework 5 in discrete mathematics.

Sure, here's a step-by-step guide to building and running a C++ project using CMake, for someone who is not familiar with the process:

Make sure that a C++ compiler is installed on your computer. If not, install it, choosing the appropriate version for your operating system.

Make sure that CMake is installed on your computer. If not, download and install it from the official website: https://cmake.org/download/

Download and extract the C++ project you want to build from the internet to a directory of your choice.

Navigate to the project directory through the terminal or command prompt.

Create a new directory called "build" inside the project directory.

Navigate to the "build" directory you just created through the terminal or command prompt.

Run the command "cmake .." to create the CMake project files.

Build the project by running the command "make".

After a successful build, you can run the project by running the command "./[executable filename]" (the executable filename will depend on the project name).

If the project does not run or you encounter errors, check for any missing dependencies and make sure they are installed.

I hope this step-by-step guide helps you build and run a C++ project using CMake.
