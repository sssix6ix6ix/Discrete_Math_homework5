## Function Description
The FindEccentricity function calculates the eccentricity of a given country in an undirected graph, represented by an unordered map with keys as country names and values as vectors of adjacent country names. The eccentricity of a node is defined as the maximum distance between that node and any other node in the graph.

The function takes a string parameter country representing the name of the country for which the eccentricity needs to be calculated. It returns a size_t value representing the eccentricity of the given country.

## Function Implementation
The function starts by creating an empty dist unordered map, which will be used to store the distance of each node from the starting country. It also creates an empty q queue to hold the nodes that are to be visited.

The starting country is added to the queue and its distance from itself is set to zero in the dist map.

The function then enters a loop that continues until there are no more nodes to visit in the queue. In each iteration of the loop, it dequeues a node from the front of the q queue and iterates over its adjacent nodes. For each adjacent node, the function checks if it has already been visited (i.e., if it exists in the dist map) or if its distance from the starting node is greater than the distance of the current node plus one. If either of these conditions is true, the function updates the distance of the adjacent node in the dist map to be one greater than the distance of the current node, and it sets the eccentricity to be the maximum of the current eccentricity and the distance of the adjacent node. The adjacent node is then added to the end of the q queue to be visited later.

Once all nodes have been visited, the function returns the eccentricity of the given country.

## Function Usage
To use the FindEccentricity function, you first need to create an instance of the graphSolver class, which contains the function. The graphSolver class must have a member variable graph, which represents the graph as an unordered map.

You can then call the FindEccentricity function on a specific country by passing its name as a string parameter. The function will return the eccentricity of the given country as a size_t value. Here is an example usage of the function:

```
graphSolver solver;
solver.graph = {
{"USA", {"Canada", "Mexico"}},
{"Canada", {"USA"}},
{"Mexico", {"USA"}}
};

size_t eccentricity = solver.FindEccentricity("USA");
std::cout << "The eccentricity of USA is " << eccentricity << std::endl;
```

In this example, the graph represents a map of North America with the USA, Canada, and Mexico as nodes. The eccentricity of the USA node is then calculated using the FindEccentricity function, and the result is printed to the console.
