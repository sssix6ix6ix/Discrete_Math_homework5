The method first creates a map dist that stores the distances between pairs of countries using their names as keys. It then initializes minimum_spanning_tree to an empty vector and minimum_length to the maximum possible value for an integer.

The method then iterates through all the countries in the graph and for each country, it calls the FindMinimumSpanningTree method defined earlier, passing in the dist map, an empty spanning_tree vector, and the name of the current country as the starting country. The FindMinimumSpanningTree method then finds the minimum spanning tree of the graph starting from that country, which is stored in the spanning_tree vector.

The length of the spanning_tree vector is then calculated by adding up the costs of all the edges in the tree. If this length is less than the current minimum length, the current minimum length is updated and the current spanning_tree is set as the new minimum_spanning_tree.

Finally, the method returns the minimum_spanning_tree vector.

Arguments:

distances : a std::map<std::string, std::vector<std::pair<std::string, int>>> object that stores the distances between pairs of countries as a map of vectors, where each vector contains a pair of the name of the destination country and the distance to that country.
Returns:

A spanningTree vector containing the minimum spanning tree of the graph.
